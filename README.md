# 🇯🇵 Japanese Learning App (React Native)

A mobile app for learning Japanese writing systems: **Hiragana**, **Katakana**, and **Kanji**.  
Includes interactive charts, pronunciation info, and a custom practice canvas.

## 📘 Overview

This app is built for beginners who want to learn Japanese through visual interaction and hands-on practice.

Users can:
- Explore full Hiragana and Katakana character charts
- Tap characters to view pronunciation and English meaning
- Learn Kanji with meaning, examples, and pronunciation types (onyomi/kunyomi)
- Practice writing characters using a drawing canvas
- Navigate smoothly using a bottom tab bar

## ✨ Features

- Full Hiragana and Katakana charts with tap-to-view details
- Detailed Kanji screen: meaning, onyomi, kunyomi, examples
- Practice mode to draw Kanji strokes
- Bottom tab navigation between sections
- Search Kanji by meaning
- Fully offline — uses static data files

## 🈶 What You Learn

The app teaches the three Japanese writing systems:

- **Hiragana (ひらがな)** – used for native Japanese words and grammar
- **Katakana (カタカナ)** – used for foreign words, names, and emphasis
- **Kanji (漢字)** – Chinese-origin characters used for meaning and structure

Each Kanji includes:
- Meaning
- Onyomi (Chinese-style reading)
- Kunyomi (Japanese-style reading)
- Stroke count
- Examples of how it’s used

Plus, users can practice writing Kanji on a built-in drawing canvas.
